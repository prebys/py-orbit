./src		- source code for the core ORBIT C++ classes, including
		  wrappers, etc.

./py		- python modules and wrapper classes for the core ORBIT
		  classes.

./ext		- source code for external modules. Compilations of this
		  code should be placed into ./modules.

./lib  	- .so shared libraries to be used under python interpreter,
		  pyORBIT.

./examples	- sample pyORBIT scripts.

./doc		- pyORBIT documentation.

./conf		- configuration information.

./bin		- directory containing pyORBIT executable.

============SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES=============

The user should define:

ORBIT_ROOT	- the full path to the directory pyORBIT.

ORBIT_ARCH	- architecture of the system. At present it is LINUX only.

PYTHON_VERSION	- python version, for example: export PYTHON_VERSION = 2.4

PYTHON_ROOT_LIB	- the name of the python library including the full path.
                  It is usually
		  /usr/lib/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)/config/libpython$(PYTHON_VERSION).a

PYTHON_ROOT_INC	- location of the python header files.
                  It is usually
		  /usr/include/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)

PYTHONPATH	- should be modified to include access to the ORBIT
		  python modules:
		  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${ORBIT_ROOT}/py:${ORBIT_ROOT}/lib
			
LD_LIBRARY_PATH - location of the shared libraries with extenstions of the pyORBIT
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${ORBIT_ROOT}/lib
			
FFTW3_ROOT - location of the root directory of the FFTW library, version 3 and above
