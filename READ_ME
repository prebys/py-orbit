User should define:

ORBIT_ROOT	- the full path to the directory pyORBIT.

MPI_ROOT	- MPI library with bin/ and lib/ directories.

PYTHON_VERSION	- python version, for example: export PYTHON_VERSION = 2.4

PYTHON_ROOT_LIB	- the name of the python library including the full path.
                  It is usually
		  /usr/lib/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)/config/libpython$(PYTHON_VERSION).a

PYTHON_ROOT_INC	- location of the python header files.
                  It is usually
		  /usr/include/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)

PYTHONPATH	- should be modified to include access to the ORBIT
		  python modules:
		  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${ORBIT_ROOT}/py

ORBIT_ARCH	- architecture of the system. At present it is LINUX only.
