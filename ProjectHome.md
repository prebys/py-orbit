PyORBIT is a Python/C++  implementation of the ORBIT (Objective Ring Beam Injection and Tracking) code. PyORBIT  software is an open environment for simulations of diverse physical processes related to particle accelerators. The original ORBIT has the Super Code driver shell which is replaced by Python in PyORBIT. At this moment only few capabilities of the original ORBIT are implemented.
