Notes about pyORBIT Development


title 01.31.2008 py::orbit::lattice modification
The initial state is a revision 59.
Problems with AccLattice and AccElement classes:

1. We need possibility to access any particular node by using its
	 name (lattice could have duplicates!) or position. The position
	 of the element cannot be a property of the node, because the same
	 node could be a part of more than one lattice or sub-lattice. Thus,
	 it should be a method of the lattice class - getPosition(index).
	 The position means the start point of the node. All other information
	 should be retrieved from node (AccElement class instance).

2. To provide the ability to track particles from one particular node
	 to another we can use sub-lattices instead of very complicated
	 start-stop methods in nodes and action containers. So, the
	 "should stop" methods can be removed from AccActionsContainer class.
	 The new method for sub-lattice generation should be introduced.

3. Initialization structure for nodes is not necessary. We need initialization
	 only for the lattice (to put positions into an array). The node
	 initialization should be moved to TEAPOT base element as a part of
	 construction of nodes.

4. AccActionsContainer has sets of similar methods for entrance, body, and
	 exit actions. It could be a shorter and clearer code if we provide
	 one set of methods with a parameter specifying ENTRANCE, BODY,
	 or EXIT.
