#summary Python class which performs particle injection into a bunch

= Summary =

This class injects particles into a pre-defined Bunch according to user-specified distribution functions. The user must specify the allowed transverse physical region for injection.  Particles outside of this region will be added to a lost particle Bunch. A library of distribution functions is available. 

= Python Accessible Classes, Methods and Variables = 
  # *InjectParts(nparts, bunch, lostbunch, injectregion, xDistFunc, yDistFunc, lDistFunc)*. Creates an injection node. Variables:
     * nparts: Number of macro particles to be during each pass through the node.
     * bunch: The bunch to be injected into.
     * lostbunch: The lost particle bunch which will accommodate injected particles outside of the injection region.
     * injectregion: A list of ransverse limits of the injection region (xmin: Horizontal minimum; xmax: Horizontal maximum; ymin: Vertical minimum; ymax: Vertical maximum).
     * xDistFunc: Horizontal distribution function. One example is JohoTransverse.
     * yDistFunc: Vertical distribution function: One example is JohoTransverse.
     * lDistFunc: Longitudinal distribution function.  Examples are JohoLongitudinal and UniformLongDist. 
  # *addParticles()*. Routine that gets the particle coordinates from the distributions, checks to make sure that they are within the injection region, and adds them to either the main bunch or the lost bunch.
