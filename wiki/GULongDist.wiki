#summary Generates longitudinal coordinates that are Gaussian in energy and uniform in z.

This class creates longitudinal particle coordinates that are uniform in z and Gaussian in energy.  

= Python Accessible Methods and Variables = 
  # *GULongDis(zmin, zmax, sp, emean, esigma, etrunc, emin, emax)*. Creates the class.
     * zmin: Minimum z of the distribution.
     * zmax: Maximum z of the distribution.
     * emean: Mean energy of the distribution.
     * esigma: Sigma spread of the energy distribution
     * etrunc: Flag for truncating the distribution.  0 is no truncation, 1 is truncation as specified by user parameters emit and emax.
     * emin: If etrunc is not 0, then this is the minimum of the energy distribution.
     * emax: If etrunc is not 0, then this is the maximum of the energy distribution.
