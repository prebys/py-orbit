#summary Summary of the Foil class

= Introduction =

This is the class for modeling proton passage through rectangular carbon stripping foils of user-defined thickness. The class does not inject particles, nor does it lose particles. Two scattering methods are available to the particles. The first is a collimator style scattering model which includes MCS, energy loss, and nuclear scattering. The second is a simplified scattering model which only includes MCS.
