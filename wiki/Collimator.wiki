#summary Description of the Collimator class

= Summary =
This class constructs a collimator and calls the materials scattering routines to propagate the particles through the collimator. The stepsize of the particle in the collimator is based on the mean free path of the particle in the chosen material with a random factor. The scattering methods used are in the MaterialInteractions class. More information on the implementation of this class can be found in the CollimatorMainPage. 


= Python Accessible Methods and Variables = 
  # *Collimator(_int_ length, _int_ ma, _double_ density_fac, _int_ shape, _double_  a, _double_ b, _double_ c, _double_ d, _double_ angle)*. An instance of a collimator. Creates a collimator. Variables:
     * length: Length of the collimator in meters
     * ma: Material type index: 1=carbon, 2=aluminum, 3=iron, 4=copper, 5=tantalum, 6=tungstun, 7=platinum, 8=lead, 9 = black absorber.
     * density_fac: A multiplier on the density of chosen material. Defaults to 1. 
     * shape: Shape type index: 1=circle, 2=ellipse, 3=one sided flat, 4=two sided flat, 5=rectangular (outside is collimator), 6=rectangular (inside is collimator). 
     * a: Radius for circular collimator, x-axis for elliptical, horizontal right side extent for flat and rectangular.
     * b: Y-axis for elliptical, left side horizontal extent for two-sided flat or rectangular. 
     * c: Upper side vertical extent for rectangular. 
     * d: Lower side vertical extent for rectangular.
     * angle: Tilt angle of the collimator defined in degrees.
  # collimateBunch(Bunch* bunch, Bunch* lostbunch)
     * bunch: The Bunch to be collimated.
     * lostbunch: The Bunch to be populated with particles absorbed in the collimator.
