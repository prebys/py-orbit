#summary Generates and SNS style longitudinal coordinates.

= Summary =

This class creates SNS style longitudinal particle coordinates. The distribution is uniform in z and Gaussian in energy, with user option for adding centroid energy jitter and sinusoidal energy variation. The class has a method which returns a single longitudinal coordinate pair (z and dE) each time it's called.
