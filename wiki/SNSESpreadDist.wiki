#summary Generates and SNS style longitudinal coordinates.

= Summary =

This class creates SNS style longitudinal particle coordinates. The distribution is uniform in z and Gaussian in energy, with user option for adding centroid energy jitter and sinusoidal energy variation. The class has a method which returns a single longitudinal coordinate pair (z and dE) each time it's called.  

= Python Accessible Methods and Variables = 
  # *SNSESpreadDist(lattlength, zmin, zmax, tailfraction, sp, emean, esigma, etrunc, emin, emax, ecparams, esparams)*. Creates the class.
     * lattlength: Total lattice length.
     * zmin: Minimum z of the distribution.
     * zmax: Maximum z of the distribution.
     * tailfraction: Fractional amount of beam to be placed in an extended tail. 
     * sp: SyncParticle object (representing the synchronous particle of the distribution).
     * emean: Mean energy of the distribution.
     * esigma: Sigma spread of the energy distribution
     * etrunc: Flag for truncating the distribution.  0 is no truncation, 1 is truncation as specified by user parameters emit and emax.
     * emin: If etrunc is not 0, then this is the minimum of the energy distribution.
     * emax: If etrunc is not 0, then this is the maximum of the energy distribution. 
     * ecparams: Parameters of the energy centroid jitter.  List is ecparams = (ecmean, ecsigma, ectrunc, ecmin, ecmax, ecdrifti, ecdriftf, drifttime), where ecmean= mean of the centroid jitter; ecsigma = sigma of the centroid jitter; ectrunc = flag for truncation (0 for none, 1 for truncate); ecmin = the minimum energy for the jittered distribution, when ectrunc is not zero; ecmax = the minimum energy for the jittered distribution, when ectrunc is not zero; ecdrifti = initial drift energy of the centroid; ecdriftf = final drift energy of the centroid; driftime = total duration of centroid drift. 
  # *getCoordinates()*. Routine that generates and returns a single coordinate pair within specified distribution. 

= Examples = 

In the following example a 
     * esparams: Parameters of the energy sinusoidal spreader.  List is esparams = (esnu, esphase, esmax, nulltime) , where esnu = frequency of the sinusoidal spreader [Hz]; esphase = constant phase of the spreader, esmax = amplitude of the spreader; nulltime = time for decay of spreader voltage
