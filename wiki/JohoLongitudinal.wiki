#summary Class for creating Joho style longitudinal coordinates.

= Summary =

Method for creating Joho style distributions in the longitudinal plane.  This class has a method which returns a single longitudinal coordinate pair (z and dE) each time it's called.  These distributions are based on the ACCSIM code Joho distribution models.
