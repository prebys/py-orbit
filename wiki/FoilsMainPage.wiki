#summary Description of how to create and use Foils.

= Summary =

This page describes how to track particles through foils. The Foil class allows the creation of rectangular carbon foils of user defined thickness and size. An arbitrary number of foils can be added to any lattice. Two different particle scattering methods are available in the Foil class. Particles are neither created nor absorbed in the foils. Python convenience scripts are available for adding foils to the lattice. From the standpoint of the lattice, foils are considered as zero length elements. 


= Python Accessible Methods and Variables =
  # *TeapotFoilNode(double xmin, double xmax, double ymin, double ymax, double thick, string name)*. Creates a teapot style foil. Variables:
     * xmin: Horizontal minimum of foil. 
     * xmax: Horizontal maximum of foil.
     * ymin: Vertical minimum of foil.
     * ymax: Vertical maximum of foil.
     * thick: Thickness of foil (ug/cm^2)
     * name: User defined name of the foil. 
  # *addTeapotFoilNode(TEAPOT_Lattice lattice, double position, TeapotFoilNode foil_node)*. A method to add the collimator to a Teapot lattice. Variables: 
     * lattice: The Teapot lattice the collimator should be added to.
     * position: The start position of the collimator in the lattice.
     * foil_node: A previously defined teapot style foil.
