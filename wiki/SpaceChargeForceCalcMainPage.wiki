#summary Summary page for 2.5D space charge force calculation

summary Description of how to use the 2.5D space charge direct force class

= Summary =

This page describes how to use the transverse, 2.5D, direct force space charge package and associated classes.  The class is translated from the ORBIT 2.5D direct force space charge class.  It uses an FFT convolution method to compute the force. This module requires the fftw3 package.

= Python Accessible Methods and Variables =
  # *DirectForce2p5D_AccNode(SC_Base_AccNode)*. Creates a 2.5D direct force space charge node. Variables:
     *SC_Base_AccNode: The space charge calculator node
  # *track(Dict paramsDict)*. A method for doing the 2.5D direct force space charge kick. Implemented by the lattice trackBunch method. 
     *paramsDict: A Dict containing the bunch.
  # *setDirectForce2p5DAccNodes(lattice, sc_path_length_min, space_charge_calculator):*. Routine to add a defined DirectForce2p5D_AccNode as a child node to an element in the lattice . Variables:
     * lattice: The teapot lattice.
     * sc_path_length_min: Minimum path length in node in order to do a kick.
