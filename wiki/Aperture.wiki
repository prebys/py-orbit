#summary The main Aperture class that absorbs particles if they are outside the user defined aperture.

#summary Description of the Aperture class.

= Summary =

This class implements a method to check if particles are outside of a user-specified aperture.  Particles outside of the aperture are removed and added to a lost particles bunch.  The method requires the presence of a main bunch for live particles and a second bunch for lost particles.

= Python Accessible Methods and Variables = 
  # *Aperture(int shape, double a, double b, double c, double d)*. An instance of an aperture. Variables:
     * shape: Shape type index. 1=circle, 2=ellipse, 3=rectangle. 
     * a: Radius for circular collimator, x-axis half length for ellipse and rectangle. 
     * b: Y-axis half length for elliptical and rectangle. Doesn't apply for circle. 
     * c: Horizontal offset. Default 0. Argument is optional.
     * d: Vertical offset. Default 0. Argument is optional.
