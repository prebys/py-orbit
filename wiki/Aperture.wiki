#summary The main Aperture class that absorbs particles if they are outside the user defined aperture.

#summary Description of the Aperture class.

= Summary =

This class implements a method to check if particles are outside of a user-specified aperture.  Particles outside of the aperture are removed and added to a lost particles bunch.  The method requires the presence of a main bunch that is tracked and a second bunch for housing the lost particles.

= Python Accessible Methods and Variables = 
  # *TeapotApertureNode(int shape, double a, double pos=0, double b=0, double c=0, double d=0)*. An instance of an aperture. Variables:
     * shape: Shape type index. 1=circle, 2=ellipse, 3=rectangle. 
     * a: Radius for circular collimator, x-axis half length for ellipse and rectangle. 
     * b: Y-axis half length for elliptical and rectangle. Doesn't apply for circle. 
     * pos: Position of aperture.  Will be overwritten if aperture is added to a lattice. Optional argument. 
     * c: Horizontal offset.Optional argument. 
     * d: Vertical offset. Optional argument. 
  # *setPosition(double position)*. The method sets the position of the collimator in the lattice.
     * position: The start position of the collimator in the lattice.
